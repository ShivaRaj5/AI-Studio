#### 3. AI Generation (Mock API)
- **Generate Button**: Click to start the generation process
- **Loading States**: Observe the spinner and status updates
- **Error Simulation**: 20% chance of "Model overloaded" error
- **Auto-retry**: Watch exponential backoff retry mechanism
- **Abort Functionality**: Click the red button to cancel generation
- **Success**: See generated image appear in history

#### 4. History Management

#### 5. Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Tab to navigate between elements
- **Focus States**: Clear visual indicators for focused elements
- **ARIA Labels**: Screen reader friendly interface
- **Enter Key**: Press Enter in prompt field to generate

### ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

#### Error Handling
1. Upload an invalid file type
2. Try to generate without image or prompt
3. Let generation fail to see retry mechanism
4. Test abort functionality during generation

#### Responsive Design
1. Resize browser window to test mobile layout
2. Test touch interactions on mobile devices
3. Verify grid layout adapts to screen size

#### Performance
1. Upload large images to test downscaling
2. Generate multiple images to test history management
3. Check localStorage persistence
